# Scripts repository

This repo regroups all the small scripts I decided to make at some point. They are in no mean complete or well coded, they are just useful for very specific things.

Here is a list of the scripts in this repo:

- [redshift-launcher](redshift-launcher)

  Its purpose is to enable or disable (toggle) [redshift](http://jonls.dk/redshift/) at a given temperature (`redshift-launcher temperature`, see redshift usage for detailed information). Quite useful to use as a keyboard shortcut and/or on login.
